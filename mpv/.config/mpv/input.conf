# mpv keybindings
#
# Location of user-defined bindings: ~/.config/mpv/input.conf
#
# Lines starting with # are comments. Use SHARP to assign the # key.
# Copy this file and uncomment and edit the bindings you want to change.
#
# List of commands and further details: DOCS/man/input.rst
# List of special keys: --input-keylist
# Keybindings testing mode: mpv --input-test --force-window --idle
#
# Use 'ignore' to unbind a key fully (e.g. 'ctrl+a ignore').
#
# Strings need to be quoted and escaped:
#   KEY show-text "This is a single backslash: \\ and a quote: \" !"
#
# You can use modifier-key combinations like Shift+Left or Ctrl+Alt+x with
# the modifiers Shift, Ctrl, Alt and Meta (may not work on the terminal).
#
# The default keybindings are hardcoded into the mpv binary.
# You can disable them completely with: --no-input-default-bindings

# Developer note:
# On compilation, this file is baked into the mpv binary, and all lines are
# uncommented (unless '#' is followed by a space) - thus this file defines the
# default key bindings.

# If this is enabled, treat all the following bindings as default.
#default-bindings start

# NOTE for mpvselectmenu configuration
# Input bindings designed to be picked up by mpvselectmenu are defined
# and commented with a '#' after the command so that it can be picked up by
# the script.
#
# The intended sequence is a series of items seperated by a pipe character.
# There can be spaces around the pipes as these will be trimmed when read in
# the mpvselectmenu script and it makes the things look a little tidier. The
# sequence of items is:
#
# Description  - This is optional text to indicate what the binding does
#                for use with the 'stats' script or '?' keybinding and is
#                first so that it's easiest to see what the binding is for.
# "MENU"       - This specifically must only be the word "MENU" (uppercase)
#                to indicate that this should be recognised by the script
#                and will ALWAYS be assumed to be either first item or after
#                the description.
# Binding name - This is to associate the binding programmatically in the
#                script. This should be unique.
# Menu text    - This should be the text that the menu item should show, or
#                use "FN" if the text should be resolved by a function.
#
# Below is an example with a description
# BINDING command # This binding does this | MENU | bindingname | Menu Text
#
# Below is an example without a description
# BINDING command # MENU | bindingname | Menu Text
#
# WARNING: Do not do have a description of "MENU" followed by the "MENU"
# item or it will cause problems:
# BINDING command # MENU | MENU | bindingname | Menu Text <- Could cause errors

# NOTE: While not strictly necessary, it's a nice idea to leave comments after
# all bindings to show on the 'stats' script's binding page ('?' binding).
